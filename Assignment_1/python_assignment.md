7. Convert `45.67` to integer and then to string.

### Dictionaries
8. Create a dictionary of a student with keys: `'name'`, `'age'`, `'grade'`. Print the dictionary.
9. Add a new key `'subject'` and update the `'grade'`.

### Loops
10. Use a `for` loop to print `"Python is fun"` 5 times.
11. Use a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.

### Functions
12. Write a function that returns the square of a number.

## üü° Intermediate Level Questions

### String Operations
1. Write a program to check if `"AI"` is in the string `"OpenAI GPT"`.

### Dictionaries and Loops
3. Given a dictionary of countries and capitals, print each pair:
    ```python

    ```
4. Remove a key `'USA'` from the dictionary.

### Sets and Typecasting
5. Create a set from the string `"banana"` and explain the result.
6. Convert a list `[1, 2, 2, 3]` to a set and then back to a tuple.

### Operators and Control Flow
7. Use logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to evaluate a few expressions and explain the result.
8. Demonstrate membership operators using a list.

### Loops and Logic

4. Use a dictionary to map students to marks, and print students who scored above 80.

### File Handling
5. Write a program to write a list of strings to a file and then read them back.
6. Append a new line to an existing file.

### Functions with *args and **kwargs
7. Write a function that accepts any number of numerical arguments and returns their average.
8. Write a function that accepts named keyword arguments and prints them in key=value format.

### Lambda and Higher-Order Functions
9. Use `lambda` to sort a list of tuples by the second element.
10. Write a program that uses `map()` and `lambda` to square all numbers in a list.
