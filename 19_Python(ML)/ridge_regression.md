## Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization) – Avoiding Overfitting

### What is Overfitting?
Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns not only the genuine patterns in the training data but also the noise. This means the model performs very well on training data but poorly on unseen (test) data, because it has essentially “memorized” the training set rather than generalizing.

### Regularization: The Antidote to Overfitting
Regularization is a technique to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty to more complex models. The idea is to discourage the model from fitting the noise in the training data by controlling the size of the model parameters (weights).

### Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that includes an L2 penalty. This penalty term is proportional to the sum of the squares of the model parameters (weights).

The cost function for Ridge Regression is:
\[
Cost_L2 = Cost_original + λ * (sum of squares of weights)
\]
- **MSE**: Mean Squared Error (standard error term for regression)
- **λ (lambda)**: Regularization parameter. Controls the strength of the penalty. Higher λ means more regularization.
- **θ_j**: Model parameters (weights)

**Key Points:**
- When λ = 0: Ridge regression becomes standard linear regression.
- When λ is very large: All weights go toward zero (except the bias term), and the model is heavily regularized.

### How Ridge Regression Avoids Overfitting
- By adding the L2 penalty, Ridge regression shrinks the coefficients (weights), making them smaller and preventing any single feature from having too much influence.
- This makes the model simpler and less likely to capture noise in the data, improving its ability to generalize to unseen data.

### Practical Notes for Implementation
- In Python, Ridge regression can be implemented using `sklearn.linear_model.Ridge`.
- It’s common to use cross-validation to select the best value of λ (alpha in scikit-learn).

### Beyond Ridge: Other Regularization Techniques
- **Lasso (L1 Regularization):** Penalizes the absolute value of the coefficients; can set some weights exactly to zero and performs feature selection.
- **Elastic Net:** Combines L1 and L2 penalties.

### Summary Table

| Method            | Penalty Term         | Effect                                  |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| None (OLS)        | —                   | May overfit                             |
| Ridge (L2)        | Sum of squares      | Shrinks all coefficients, keeps all vars |
| Lasso (L1)        | Sum of absolutes    | Shrinks some coefficients to zero        |
| Elastic Net       | L1 + L2 combined    | Mix of the above                        |

### Conclusion
Ridge regression (L2 regularization) is a powerful tool to prevent overfitting in linear models. By penalizing large weights, it encourages simpler models that generalize better on new data.
