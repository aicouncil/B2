# Explanation of `el_ds_6(ml_classification).ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates a basic workflow for a **machine learning classification problem** using Python, pandas, and matplotlib, centered around a customer churn dataset. Below, each section of the notebook is explained with examples and key concepts.

---

## 1. Importing Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib.pyplot**: For data visualization.

---

## 2. Loading the Dataset

```python
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bipulshahi/Dataset/refs/heads/main/Churn_Modelling.csv')
df.head()
```

- Reads a CSV file directly from a URL into a pandas DataFrame.
- `df.head()` displays the first 5 rows.

**Sample Output Table:**

| RowNumber | CustomerId | Surname  | CreditScore | Geography | Gender | Age | Tenure | Balance   | NumOfProducts | HasCrCard | IsActiveMember | EstimatedSalary | Exited |
|-----------|------------|----------|-------------|-----------|--------|-----|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| 1         | 15634602   | Hargrave | 619         | France    | Female | 42  | 2      | 0.00      | 1             | 1         | 1              | 101348.88       | 1      |
| ...       | ...        | ...      | ...         | ...       | ...    | ... | ...    | ...       | ...           | ...       | ...            | ...             | ...    |

---

## 3. Target Variable Inspection

```python
df['Exited'].unique()
```

- Checks the unique values in the "Exited" column, the target variable for classification.
- Output: `array([1, 0])`
  - **1**: Customer exited (churned)
  - **0**: Customer retained

---

## 4. Data Cleaning: Removing Irrelevant Columns

```python
df1 = df.drop(columns = ['RowNumber', 'CustomerId', 'Surname'])
df1.head()
```

- Removes columns that don't contribute to prediction ("RowNumber", "CustomerId", "Surname").
- The resulting DataFrame is more focused on relevant features.

---

## 5. Checking for Missing Values

```python
df.isna().sum()
```

- Checks each column for missing values.
- Result: All columns have **0 missing values**.
- This means the dataset is "clean" regarding nulls.

---

## 6. Data Shape

```python
df1.shape
```

- Output: `(10000, 11)`
  - 10,000 rows (customers)
  - 11 columns (features + target variable)

---

## 7. Separating Numerical and Categorical Columns

```python
df_num = df1.select_dtypes(include='number')
df_num.head()
```

- Selects only numerical columns for further processing or analysis.
- **Example of numerical columns:**
  - CreditScore
  - Age
  - Tenure
  - Balance
  - NumOfProducts
  - HasCrCard
  - IsActiveMember
  - EstimatedSalary
  - Exited

---

### Example: Why Do This?

- **Numerical columns** are often scaled, normalized, or fed directly into machine learning models.
- **Categorical columns** (like 'Geography', 'Gender') may require encoding (e.g., one-hot encoding).

## Summary Table

| Step                          | Purpose                                      | Example/Explanation |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Importing Libraries           | Bring in tools for data analysis & plotting  | `import pandas...` |
| Loading Dataset               | Get data into your workspace                 | `pd.read_csv(...)` |
| Checking Target Values        | Understand the classes to predict            | `df['Exited'].unique()` |
| Removing Irrelevant Columns   | Focus on useful features                     | Drop ID columns    |
| Checking for Missing Values   | Ensure data quality                          | `df.isna().sum()`  |
| Checking Data Shape           | Know dataset size                            | `(10000, 11)`      |
| Separating Numerical Columns  | Prep for modeling                            | `select_dtypes()`  |

## Practical Example Workflow

Suppose you want to build a model predicting if a customer will churn:
1. **Load and Inspect Data**  
   Get the CSV, look at the first few rows, and see what information is available.
2. **Remove Unnecessary Columns**  
   Drop columns that are identifiers or not useful for prediction.
3. **Check for Missing Data**  
   Ensure no NaNsâ€”otherwise, fill or drop as needed.
4. **Understand the Features**  
   Separate out numerical and categorical features for appropriate preprocessing.

---

## What Next?

Typically, after these steps, you would:
- **Encode categorical variables** (like 'Geography', 'Gender') using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
- **Scale numerical variables** if needed.
- **Split data into training and testing sets**.
- **Train a classification model** (like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).
- **Evaluate model performance** (using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.).

---

## Conclusion

This notebook walks through the essential initial steps for a **machine learning classification task**:
- Data loading
- Cleaning
- Understanding structure
- Preparing for modeling

You can build on this foundation by adding feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps.
